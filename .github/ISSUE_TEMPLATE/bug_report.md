## Are you using one of our development environments? 

We provide a preconfigured AWS AMI and a VM to help our customers skip the environment setup part and jump straight to development. We highly suggest using one of our development environments to run our code. 

If the issue is not related to code, then you can simply skip this question. 

## If you are using your own development environment then please provide the following details.

* GPU model and CUDA version: (skip if not application) 
* OS Platform: 
* Python version: 
* OpenCV version: 

## Describe the issue
